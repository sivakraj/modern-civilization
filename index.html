        <h2>Basis of Modern Civilization</h2>
        <p>
          Man had gone wrong in his quest for technological development. Modern civilization is simply based on
          working hard, earning lots of money and spending the hard earned money lavishly for sense enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Civilization with such a gross motive wouldn't thrive and would largely put people in unhealthy and unhappy way of life.
          Human Life is not meant for sense gratification but rather to understand and realize God by conduting life with a motto of
          "simple living, and high thinking". God realization includes understanding about one's own self as well.

        <h2>Faults of Modern Civilization</h2>
        <p>The main fault of the modern civlization, as said in the Basis section, is based on two things viz Hard work and Sense gratification.
        </p>
        <p>People have wrong idea that by advancing materially, they can be happy. But it is not so. We can see that despite the so called development
          of science and it's products, freeways, attempt to travel to different planets, sky scrapers, slaughter houses, mobile gadgets etc., they are not happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          People are now more health conscious than a 100, 50 or even 20 years ago because the current civlization not only reduced
          the life time of people but made their life horribly less healthy the short time they leave.

        <h2>What is The Remedy?</h2>
        <p>Remedy is to go back to traditional Vedic way of life.</p>

        <p>
        In traditional socieites man fulfilled his needs in a simple and eco-friendly way. Material requirements were met
        without undue struggle. There were no industrial complexes producing endless varieties of unnecessary accessiories to an
        artificial way of life; nor were there huge shopping plazas for touting unwanted goods; nor was there an advertizing industry
        goading the masses to buy such things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The economic system was based on need, not greed. Trade was limited and mostly buy barter-- "I give you something you need, you give me somthing I need."
          There were no stocks, shares, market crashes, currency speculations, budget balancing, inflation, mass unemployement, or strikes.
        </p>
        <p>Life's basic necessities-- food, clothing, housing materials, and fuel--were avaialble from the land. Cotton was spun at home.
          Every village would have a potter to make vessels for cooking. In larger villages a blacksmith would forge simple farming and cooking
          utensils, razors(one razor would last a life time), and other such items, using either non-locally produced or recycled metals.</p>
        <p>
          Rope and string were made locally from fibres of plants such as coconut, jute, and flax. Water was available from
          rivers, wells, and ponds. There was no need for water works, sewage systems, lavatories, or taps. Nor was there need of
          electricity, for people were accustomed to living without complex machines. Lamps burning home-produced vegetable oils supplied light.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heat of summer would be tolerated with bamboo hand fans giving a little relief; winter would be met with extra blankets and wood fires.

          Medicines, cosmetics, and dyes were made at home from plants, rocks and natural ingredients. Furniture was not required, for people
          would sit, eat, cook, study, and sleep on the floor.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Before winding up...</p>

        <p>A prinicipal goal of an enlightened culture is to elevate its memebers to their ultimate capacity. A truly
          advanced society strives not simply for the ephemeral requirements of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending,
          for even animals do that. Real human civilization begins with philosophical inquiry into the nature of God, the universe,
          and the onotological poisiton of living beings.</p>
