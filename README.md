# Modern Civlization
A multi-sectional landing page on Modern Civilization

A multi-sectional landing page on _Modern Civilization_ created as part of my carrier sojourn towards the front end development. This page simply shows how the modern civilization is completely deviated from tradition vedic life and undergoing chaos at every step.

This webpage is created with two purposes, one is to provide knowledge on topics of faults of modern civlization and other is to practice few JS skills in making the page more dynamic.
